**Hi!** I'm currently in my second year pursuing engineering degree in computer science at Wrocław University of Technology, Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology [(website)](http://wppt.pwr.edu.pl/). Here are some interesting curses i worked or am currently working on during my studies:

### Current curses
- **Reliable Systems**

Creating reliable, predictable and safe software using SPARK (subset of Ada) programming language.
- **Mobile Applications**

Developing android applicatons using Kotlin language and the most recent technologies in mobile enviroment.
- **Concurrent Programming**

Learning alogorithms and solving problems in councurrent programming, using Go and Ada languages.  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**

One of the most important (and interesting) curse during our studies. Graphs, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and much more. Also, implementing obtained knowledge in selected language (currently working in C).

### Completed curses
- **Data Bases and Information Management**

MySql, optimalization, connectors.
- **Computer Architecture and Operating Systems**

Deep knowledge of Unix-like systems, C programming and Bash scripts.
- **Probability and Statistics**

Math - from variance to normal distribution.
- **Programming** and **Programming Technology**

Mainly java programming, software development.

**In conclusion**, I feel confident (mastering, learning specific topics will be much faster) i.a. in those fields:

- Java
- Kotlin
- C
- Ada
- Go
- Bash
- MySql

### My repositories
- [Chinesee Checkers](https://github.com/mpodgorny/Trylma) - Project made in pairs, using Java (SDK 8) in client-server architecture.
- [Computer Architecture](https://github.com/mpodgorny/AKiSO) - Tasks completed for this course, involving C and Bash scripts.
- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/mpodgorny/Algorytmy-i-Struktury-Danych) - Code for ongoing course.
### Currently working on
Getting my work of 1 year systematized and pushed to GitHub (besides studying, duh).
 
### My IT interests
- Reading __Introduction to Algorithms__(T.H. Cormen) in trams.
- Better understandment of C language.
