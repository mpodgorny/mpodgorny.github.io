Hi! I'm currently in my second year pursuing engineering degree in computer science at Wrocław University of Technology, Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology [faculty page](http://wppt.pwr.edu.pl/). Here are some interesting curses i worked or am currently working on during my studies:

### Current curses
- **Reliable Systems**
Creating reliable, predictable and safe software using SPARK (subset of Ada) programming language.
- **Mobile Applications**
Developing android applicatons using Kotlin language and the most recent technologies in mobile enviroment.
- **Concurrent Programming**
Learning alogorithms and solving problems in councurrent programming, using Go and Ada languages.  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**
One of the most important (and interesting) curse during our studies. Graphs, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and much more. Also, implementing obtained knowledge in selected language (currently working in C).

### Completed curses
- **Data Bases and Information Management**
MySql, optimalization, connectors.
- **Computer Architecture and Operating Systems**
Deep knowledge of Unix-like systems, C programming and Bash scripts.
- **Probability and Statistics**
Math - from variance to normal distribution.

### Programming skills
- Java
- Kotlin
- C
- Ada
- Go
- Bash
- MySql

### Currently working on
Getting my work of 1 year systematized and pushed to GitHub (besides studying, duh).
